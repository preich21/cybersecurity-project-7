🚨 MALICIOUS UPDATE 🚨

This is a FAKE update created by an attacker!

If you see this message, it means:
- The attacker successfully redirected your traffic
- The attacker served a fake update
- BUT: The signature verification should FAIL

This demonstrates why signed updates are critical for security.

Malicious payload would contain:
- Backdoors
- Data exfiltration code
- Ransomware
- Supply chain attack code

In a real attack, this would compromise your system!
